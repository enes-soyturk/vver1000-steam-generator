# vver1000-steam-generator
Development of a Control System Model for the VVER-1000 Steam Generator

Overview

This project is my specialist graduation thesis completed at the National Research Nuclear University MEPhI in 2021.
The work focuses on developing a control system model for the RYC-01 level regulator in the blowdown expansion tank of the VVER-1000 steam generator.

The goal was to design, model, and simulate the system to ensure safe and efficient regulation of water level, using modern software tools and control methods.
